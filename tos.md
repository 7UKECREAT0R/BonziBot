### Message Content
Users are individually responsible for any content shown inside messages not included in the original source. Messages containing text that is illegal, offensive or otherwise against Discord Terms of Service is completely out of the realm of control by the BonziBot development team, aside from tags. Creating tags that contain content that fits in the aformentioned criteria is an individual violation of our rules and will be dealt with upon discovery.

### Currency
The distribution or selling of any currency inside the bot for any tangible real world asset is disallowed, regardless of the number of steps required to attain it (e.g., cryptocurrency). Upon discovery, all application currency will be revoked to zero.
