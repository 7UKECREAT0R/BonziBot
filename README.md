# BonziBot
The most epicest epic bot for epic gamers! Now with open source code for you guys!<br />
*Note this is not the current build that is being run. This is a complete re-code<br />
from scratch because the old codebase sucked major doo doo slab*

## Where can I get it?
[RIGHT HERE!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=545806922209558537&permissions=2150927424&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

## but can I steal the code...?
go for it! it might take a little bit of effort to get it un-bonzi-ified but the infrastructure is built to be SUPER malleable and expandable. enjoy using the custom gui library, graphics library, command system, argument parsers, event waiters, event manager, and executor system!

### you must do these things if you use BonziBot's source:
- share the same license as this project (GPL-3)
- link back to this project on your home page and in the bot.
- make sure to open source your project.
