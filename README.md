# BonziBot
The most epicest epic bot for epic gamers! Now with open source code for you guys!<br />
*Note this is not the current build that is being run. This is a complete re-code<br />
from scratch because the old codebase sucked major doo doo slab*

## Where can I get it?
[RIGHT HERE!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=545806922209558537&permissions=2150927424&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

## But can I steal the code...?
yeah go for it but make sure you adhere to these terms:<br />
- Include a notice or note which states where the snippets of code/code came from.<br />This must be visible somewhere in the bot itself.
- Note what parts of the code you changed. This could be changing some of the text,<br />the color of an embed, etc...
- Your bot must be open source. Self explanitory, release your source code.
- You must have the same license on the bot source code. (GNU-GPL 3.0)

enjoy using the custom gui library, graphics library, command system, argument parsers, event waiters, event manager, and executor system if so!
