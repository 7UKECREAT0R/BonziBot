# BonziBot Terms of Use & Privacy Policy
### If you do not agree to any listed information being stored, refusal to participate in the use of BonziBot is enough unless stated otherwise.
## Publicity
Your name (not including discriminator), premium status, and developer-assigned status may be expressed to the public domain in places like leaderboards under the circumstance that you meet the required standards to appear there. If you no longer share any servers with BonziBot, you and your information will be removed from all leaderboards.
## Tag Content
Any tags created by you with the tag privacy server setting set to "Public" will be visible and usable for all users who use BonziBot. Your user-name at the time will appear under the tag information if viewed by a user. Keeping tag privacy to "Private" will only allow users in the Server of which it was created to view this information.
## Profiles
Any data you input into your BonziBot profile will be kept for an indefinite period of time until manually removed, either by user or developer. This includes images, bio, birthday, time zone, and anything else that can be inputted into the social profile. By using the profiles feature, you agree to having that data be made public.
## Direct Messages
If an action or command is performed in the direct messages between you and BonziBot, you agree to being generally messaged when appropriate. Actions such as being banned may send you an unsolicited direct message and can be turned off by running `/privacy DMs false`.
## Message Content
If a user adds your message to their personal pins, a short preview of its content will be stored there indefinitely until the source user unpins it themselves. The special command "expose" recovers the last deleted message sent by a user in the server it was executed in. This means that a deleted message's content can be recovered until 100 messages are sent after the source message. You can opt-out of this by running `/privacy Messages false`. This guarantees that the contents of deleted messages will not be recoverable through any medium accessible by users or BonziBot developers.
